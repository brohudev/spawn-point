## Iterative Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Project Foundation

#### Step 1: Initial Project Setup

```
Create a new GitHub repository for the SPWNPT project with the following structure:
1. Create a root directory with frontend/ and backend/ subdirectories
2. Initialize a basic README.md explaining the project purpose
3. Add .gitignore files appropriate for Python and JavaScript projects
4. Create package.json in the root for managing workspace dependencies
5. Set up initial configuration files (.editorconfig, .prettierrc)

The project should follow a monorepo structure where frontend and backend are distinct packages but part of the same repository. The frontend will be built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, while the backend will use Flask.

Please provide the necessary files and directory structure to get started.
```

#### Step 2: Frontend Foundation

```
Set up the Astro frontend for SPWNPT with Tailwind CSS integration. The frontend will be deployed to Cloudflare Pages and needs to have:

1. Initialize an Astro project in the frontend/ directory
2. Configure Tailwind CSS with the Rose Pine theme
3. Create a basic layout component with header and footer
4. Set up the landing page (index.astro) with a placeholder for the command generator
5. Add appropriate TypeScript configurations
6. Configure the build process for Cloudflare Pages deployment

Make sure the Rose Pine theme is properly integrated with Tailwind CSS. The interface should be clean and minimal, focusing on developer experience.

Please provide the necessary files and configurations for this setup.
```

#### Step 3: Backend API Foundation

```
Implement the basic Flask backend API for SPWNPT that will generate the installer scripts. The backend needs:

1. Set up a Flask application in the backend/ directory
2. Configure CORS to allow requests from the frontend
3. Create a basic route structure with:
   - /api/health - Status endpoint
   - /api/gen - Script generation endpoint (stub for now)
4. Add error handling middleware
5. Set up a development server configuration
6. Create a requirements.txt file with necessary dependencies
7. Add a Dockerfile for deployment to Render

The backend should be designed to eventually generate Python scripts based on user selections. For now, focus on the API structure and basic response handling.

Please provide the necessary files and implementation for this setup.
```

#### Step 4: Basic Installer Script

```
Create the core Python installer script that will be generated and streamed to users. This script should:

1. Create a standalone Python file that can be executed via curl | python
2. Implement basic argument parsing for flags like --project-type, --ci, and --deploy
3. Set up logging functionality for user feedback
4. Create placeholder functions for the main installation steps
5. Implement a basic help/usage display
6. Ensure the script is cross-platform compatible at a basic level

This script will be the foundation that users download and execute. It should be self-contained and require minimal dependencies to run.

Please provide the Python script implementation with proper structure and basic functionality.
```

#### Step 5: OS Detection & Dependency Management

```
Enhance the Python installer script with robust OS detection and dependency management capabilities. Implement:

1. Platform detection logic (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Functions to check for required dependencies:
   - Python version check (>=3.12)
   - Node.js version check (>=18)
   - Package managers (npm, pip)
3. OS-specific installation commands for missing dependencies:
   - Windows: winget install
   - macOS: brew install
   - Linux: apt-get install
4. Add retry logic with proper error handling
5. Implement fallback mechanisms when primary installation methods fail

The script should gracefully handle different environments and provide clear feedback to users when issues occur.

Please extend the installer script with these capabilities.
```

### Phase 2: Template Engine & Scaffolding

#### Step 6: Template System Architecture

```
Implement a template system for the installer script using Jinja2. This system should:

1. Add Jinja2 as a dependency in the installer script
2. Create a structure for storing template files as strings in the script (to keep it self-contained)
3. Implement template loading and rendering functionality
4. Create a context management system for template variables
5. Add helper functions for template manipulation
6. Implement a basic template for testing the system

The template system will be used to generate project files based on user selections. It needs to be flexible while remaining contained within a single Python script.

Please implement this template system as part of the installer script.
```

#### Step 7: Frontend Template Implementation

```
Create the Next.js frontend templates within the template system. Implement:

1. Template for initializing a Next.js project with TypeScript

```

#### Step 8: Backend Template Implementation

```
Create the Flask backend templates within the template system. Implement:

1. Template for a Flask application factory pattern
2. SQLAlchemy ORM setup template
3. Database configuration template (PostgreSQL/Supabase)
4. API routes template with CORS configuration
5. Basic model templates
6. Requirements.txt template with pinned dependencies

```

#### Step 9: Git & VS Code Templates

```
Implement common configuration templates for Git and VS Code. Create:

1. .gitignore template with appropriate exclusions for frontend and backend
2. VS Code settings.json template with recommended extensions and configurations
3. Git initialization commands and initial commit message

3. Implement an OperationQueue for sequencing operations
4. Add transaction-like behavior (all operations succeed or all fail)
5. Implement logging for operations
6. Create helper functions for common operation sequences

This framework will ensure reliable project setup with proper error handling and rollback capabilities.

Please implement this atomic operation framework within the installer script.

1. Refine argument parsing to handle all possible flags:
   - --project-type [front|back|full]
   - --ci [github|gitlab]
   - --deploy [vercel|heroku|aws|cloudflare]
   - --no-git (to skip git initialization)
